# Under Construction

This package is not ready for general use yet.

# Discriminative<wbr>Circuits<wbr>.jl

This package provides functionalities for learning/constructing discriminative circuits (including LogisticCircuits, RegressionCircuits, etc). It is part of the [Juice package](https://github.com/Juice-jl) (Julia Circuit Empanada).

## Testing

To make sure everything is working correctly, you can run our test suite as follows. The first time you run the tests will trigger a few slow downloads of various test resources.

```bash
julia --color=yes -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test("DiscriminativeCircuits")'
```
